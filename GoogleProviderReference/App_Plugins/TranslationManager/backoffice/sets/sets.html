                            <h3>Translation Sets</h3>
                            <p>
                                Translation Sets define where the content you want to translate comes from, and where you want it to go once it is translated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A Translation Set has a single master site where all the content in the source language will be stored, and one or more target
                                sites where the translated values will be sent to.
                            </p>
                            <hr />
                            <h4>Master Site</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Master Site is the site where the translated content will come from. This will be the master language in all translations.
                            </p>
                            <hr />
                            <h4>Target Sites</h4>
                            <p>
                                Target Sites must have a language set in their 'culture and hostnames' section - this is then used as the target language for
                                translations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Target Sites are automatically related to the master site
                                so that Translation Manager knows how to match the content
                                pages up between the sites.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you first create your Target Site in Umbraco, it is recommended you do this by making a copy of the Master Site.
